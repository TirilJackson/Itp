<h1>Band assignment in class</h1>
we had an idea to make a webpage about our hard rock metal band called scream 
we used github cheat sheet website guide to get started for our process
we typed in our main header <h1>Scream</h1>
We typed in our second header about us <h2>About Us</h2>
We used chat gpt to get the information part about our band. 
lorenzo found the link to add our spotify 
we made new headers for each of our band member descriptions 
we got the information about each of the band members by asking chat gpt 
we pasted the information in 
we found an image of a female rock group online and I photoshoped our faces on the image 
We edited the picture so that it was put as the background of the website
