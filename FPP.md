#Immigration Resource Locator 

I want to try to create a platform that tracks immigrant rights and policy changes at federal state level. Users can chose their state and recieve updates about any changes in immigration law and policies that could effect them. For now maybe I will make one only for Massachusets. 

I will be using chat gpt for guidence on some of the steps for the coding. 
"https://chatgpt.com/"
I will be using massachusets law page for immigration laws 
"https://www.mass.gov/info-details/massachusetts-law-about-immigration"
I will be using free code camp to better understand java script 
"https://www.freecodecamp.org/"

The website wil serve as an educational tool so that imigrants can stay informed about their rights and inform about any changes that could effect their status in the us. 

The softwear will offer a user firendly interface where users can acess information and updates about the immigration process like asylum, work visas, protected status, and other legal matters. userw will be able to filter updates absed on key words. updates will be labeled by date and brief discription. I also want to try to make it fetch darta in real time but it might be coded in for now. 

This will not overlap with any other project 

I want to make a page that can collect information about the immigration laws. 

A better outcome is if I am able to make the site organized with dates and updates from massachusets laws so that people here can have an easy acess place where they could learn about their rights. 

I think an amazing outcome would be me figuring out how to code the data so that it could automatically fetch new updates about immigration laws and rights. And that I am able to understand this amount of coding. I am a little worried I am trying to do to much here. 

My next step is to learn more about the laws to make sure I am collecting my information from the right palce. I also need to understand the coding of the website as well as understanding HTML, Javascript and CSS
