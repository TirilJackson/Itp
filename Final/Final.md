The Process of creating my website 

I started off looking at the coding we did for our practice website in class since we used mine to create it. 
I looked over the information that was sent to me for the API and made an app there. I managed to creat a case search bar for the website where people can search their case number to see how the case is going. I am not completly sure the search bar for this works as I do not have a case number myself to test out but it is something I could potentially work on if I wnat to develop the page further. 


My origignal plan was to have the page update itself with new information but found that this was harder then I thought. I ended up deciding to do a page that focuses on immigration Resources in Massachusetts with a focus on international studetns. I wanted to add information about OPT, Free legal help, information about rights, DHS information for international students and general help in crisis for a place to sleep and eat. 
I tried a lot of problemsolving both using the internet to reaserch coding and the github pages from class where we have information about how to imbet a link and set up a website.I also used chat gpt for the styling of the website and coding help when mine failed. 

I prompted my idea for the website that I originally submited for my idea and had chat gpt create a step for step guide on how I can creat this kind of website.
I used textmate and copied the coding in to my github html file. I made one file for js one file for html and one for css for style. 
I asked chat gpt how to code for getting a specific style layout with blue, green and orane colors. I worked witht the website to create a
