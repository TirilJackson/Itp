05fuctions codealong 
Found 3 wavefiles that I could use for the project 
opend up the p5js editor in google 
signed in using my user name 
set up the mic set up using the codealong 
Tried out the code with only one sound. 
Tried modifying the code to work for 3 sounds. Repeated the code from 30-39 for each sound. 
It did not work.
Asked Chat Gpt for how I can modify this code for 3 sounds 
I got an answer saying I needed to load three separate sounds and allow for their playback with different triggers or controls. 
Chat gpt gave me a modifyed verison of the code. 
I uploaded my 3 sounds and copied the code given from chat gpt in to the coding sight 
it worked
