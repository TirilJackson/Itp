#Python Reading 

Chapter 1, I learned about syntax rules I have not heard the term before. I did not know it comes in to fromes the tokens and structure of a language. 
I know that errors usually are refered to as buggs and finding the errors usually are called debugging. 

In chapter 3  I learned that a moduble is a file that contains a collection of related fuctions. 
I canÂ´say I knew any of the information that was talked about. I guess I do know the word fuctions and basic math. 

Chapter 5 I learned the term Boolean expression- an expression that is eigther true or false. 
I know the word digits and x is not equal to y.

Chapter 10
U can create a list by enclsoing your elements in a bracket and that a list is a sequence of values. 
I could say I know the term filter sinc it is filtering spesific information that has been determind for it to look for.
